🛡️  MCP Defender is a desktop application that automatically protects your computer from malicious MCP traffic.

🚦 All MCP tool call requests and responses from AI apps like Cursor, Claude and Windsurf are automatically proxied through MCP Defender.

🔎  The intercepted data is then checked against security signatures - if anything harmful is detected, MCP Defender will alert you and ask if you want to allow or block the tool call from proceeding.

# Quick Start

[Download MCP Defender for Mac](https://mcpdefender.com)

Windows & Linux Coming Soon

Alternatively you can clone the git repo, and run it as follows:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start app
npm start
```
# Demos
